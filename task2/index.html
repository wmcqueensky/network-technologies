      <p>
        Ethernet standards for the physical layer refer to the specifications
        that define the physical characteristics of Ethernet networks, including
        the cables, connectors, voltages, and signaling methods used to transmit
        data over the network.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ethernet limits generally refer to the maximum data transmission rates,
        cable lengths, and other technical constraints imposed by each Ethernet
        standard. For example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>10BASE-T:</strong> Maximum data rate of 10 Mbps, cable length
          limit of 100 meters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>100BASE-T:</strong> Maximum data rate of 100 Mbps, cable
          length limit of 100 meters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1000BASE-T:</strong> Maximum data rate of 1 Gbps, cable length
          limit of 100 meters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>10GBASE-T:</strong> Maximum data rate of 10 Gbps, cable length
          limit of 100 meters (though this might vary based on cable and
          equipment).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        An Ethernet frame is the basic unit of data transmitted over an Ethernet
        network. It consists of various fields that contain information such as
        source and destination addresses, data payload, frame length, and
        error-checking information like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). The
        typical structure of an Ethernet frame includes:
      </p>

      <p>
        When data is broadcasted, the sender uses a special MAC address called
        the broadcast address. In Ethernet networks, this address consists of
        all binary 1s (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF in hexadecimal notation) and indicates
        that the data should be sent to all devices on the network. Any device
        listening on the network will receive the broadcasted message, but only
        the device that matches the intended criteria within the message will
        process it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Broadcasting is commonly used for various network tasks, such as address
        resolution (like ARP - Address Resolution Protocol), discovering devices
        on the network, or sending information that needs to be received by all
        devices, like some types of network configuration or management
        messages.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Preamble:</strong> A sequence of bits used for synchronization
          and indicating the start of the frame.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Destination and Source MAC Addresses:</strong> Identifiers
          that specify the intended recipient and the sender of the frame.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Type or Length:</strong> Indicates the type of data or the
          length of the frame.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Payload:</strong> The actual data being transmitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Frame Check Sequence (FCS):</strong> A CRC field used for
          error detection.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The frame structure might slightly differ based on the Ethernet standard
        being used, but these components are fundamental to the structure of
        Ethernet frames.
      </p>

      <h1>Task 1.2</h1>
      <p>
        A MAC address (media access control address) is a 12-digit hexadecimal
        number assigned to each device connected to the network. Primarily
        specified as a unique identifier during device manufacturing, the MAC
        address is often found on a device's network interface card (NIC). A MAC
        address is required when trying to locate a device or when performing
        diagnostics on a network device. The MAC address belongs to the data
        link layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, which
        encapsulates the MAC address of the source and destination in the header
        of each data frame to ensure node-to-node communication. Each network
        interface in a device is assigned a unique MAC address, so it's possible
        for a device to have more than one MAC address. For example, if a laptop
        has both an Ethernet cable port and built-in Wi-Fi, there will be two
        MAC addresses shown in the system configuration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Broadcasting: On the other hand, when data is broadcasted, the sender
        uses a special MAC address called the broadcast address. In Ethernet
        networks, this address consists of all binary 1s (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF in
        hexadecimal notation) and indicates that the data should be sent to all
        devices on the network. Any device listening on the network will receive
        the broadcasted message, but only the device that matches the intended
        criteria within the message will process it.

      <h1>Task 1.4</h1>
      <p>
        CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
        Detection. It is a network access method used in Ethernet networks to
        manage how devices access the network medium (such as a shared cable) to
        avoid data collisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Carrier Sense (CS):</strong> Devices using CSMA/CD listen to
          the network before transmitting data. If the network is idle (no
          ongoing transmissions), they can proceed to send data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multiple Access (MA):</strong> Multiple devices share the same
          network medium, such as a shared cable segment. CSMA/CD allows
          multiple devices to access this shared medium.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Collision Detection (CD):</strong> If two devices attempt to
          transmit data simultaneously and their signals collide, resulting in
          data corruption, CSMA/CD detects this collision. When a collision is
          detected, the transmitting devices stop, wait for a random backoff
          time, and then retransmit.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Collision: </strong>A collision occurs in a network when two or
        more devices attempt to send data over the network medium
        simultaneously. When collisions happen, the data sent by each device
        becomes garbled and unusable, leading to a loss of transmission
        efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Half Duplex: </strong>In half-duplex communication, devices can
        both send and receive data, but not simultaneously. They can either
        transmit or receive at any given time. With CSMA/CD, devices in a
        half-duplex Ethernet network must listen to the network to check for
        collisions while they are transmitting.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Full Duplex: </strong> In contrast, full-duplex communication
        allows devices to transmit and receive data simultaneously, doubling the
        potential throughput compared to half-duplex. Devices in a full-duplex
        setup don't need to listen for collisions because they have dedicated
        paths for sending and receiving data.
      </p>

      <p>
        In modern Ethernet networks, especially in switched environments,
        CSMA/CD is less relevant due to the prevalence of full-duplex
        communication and switched networks. Most modern Ethernet standards,
        such as Gigabit Ethernet and beyond, operate in full-duplex mode, and
        CSMA/CD is not used in these scenarios.
      </p>

      <h1>Task 1.5</h1>
      <p>
        The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is an important protocol that can
        map IP addresses to MAC addresses. It facilitates communication between
        devices on the same network. Without ARP, software and devices would not
        be able to send data to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Detecting doubled IP addresses typically involves scenarios where two or
        more devices on the same network mistakenly or maliciously have the same
        IP address. This situation can lead to network conflicts and
        communication issues. Here are some methods to detect doubled IP
        addresses:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>ARP Conflict Detection:</strong> Detection method involving
          unexpected ARP replies or inconsistencies in MAC-to-IP mappings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Network Monitoring Tools:</strong> Specialized tools that
          continuously scan the network, flagging duplicate IP addresses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Network Auditing and Inventory:</strong> Regular audits and
          maintaining IP address inventories to identify conflicting
          assignments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DHCP Lease Management:</strong> Monitoring DHCP logs or
          management consoles for IP address conflicts when assigning leases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Resolving the conflict involves reassigning unique IP addresses to the
        affected devices to ensure proper communication and prevent network
        disruptions.
      </p>

      <h1>Task 1.6</h1>

      <h3>BOOTP</h3>
      <p>
        BOOTP, or the Bootstrap Protocol, is a networking protocol used to
        assign IP addresses to computers on a network. It is an early
        predecessor of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), and it can be
        used to configure computers on a network without having to manually
        enter the settings each time. BOOTP works by assigning an IP address
        from a pool of available addresses, as well as other settings such as
        DNS servers and default gateway information. The computer that requests
        an IP address from the BOOTP server will then use this information to
        configure its network interface card (NIC). BOOTP does not support IPv6,
        so if you are looking for an IPv6-compatible protocol, DHCP is your best
        option. DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and it
        offers more features than BOOTP. It can be used for both IPv4 and IPv6
        networks and it also supports additional features such as dynamic
        address assignment, lease renewal, and more.
      </p>

      <h3>DHCP</h3>
      <p>
        Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol used to
        assign IP addresses to devices on a network. It enables automatic
        configuration of network devices, which simplifies the process of
        connecting them to the internet. DHCP works by assigning unique IP
        addresses to each device that connects to a network, allowing them to
        communicate with each other and access resources on the network. It also
        allows for more efficient management of IP address allocation and
        provides additional security features such as authentication and
        encryption. With DHCP, users can easily connect their computers,
        tablets, and other devices quickly and securely without having to
        manually configure their settings.
      </p>
      <h1>Task 1.7</h1>
      <p>
        A virtual LAN (VLAN) is a logical overlay network that groups together a
        subset of devices that share a physical LAN, isolating the traffic for
        each group. A VLAN, like the LAN it sits atop, operates at Layer 2 of
        the network, the Ethernet level.
        <br />
        VLANs partition a single switched network into a set of overlaid virtual
        networks that can meet different functional and security requirements.
        This partitioning avoids the need to have multiple, distinct physical
        networks for different use cases.

        <br />
        <br />
        Network engineers use VLANs for multiple reasons, including the
        following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>to improve performance</li>
        <li>to tighten security</li>
        <li>to ease administration</li>
      </ul>
