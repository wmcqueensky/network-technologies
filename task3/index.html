        <h1>Task 1.1</h1>
        <div class="ip">
            <p>1. <strong>IP addresses </strong>are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on
                a network: they
                contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to
                differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so
                and form an essential part of how the internet works. An IP address is a string of numbers separated by
                periods. IP addresses are expressed as a set of four numbers — an example address might be 192.158.1.38.
                Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to
                255.255.255.255.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="network-subnets">
            <p>2. <strong>Network subnets</strong> are networks inside a network. Subnets make networks more efficient.
                Through
                subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to
                reach its destination.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="network-classes">
            <p>3. <strong>Network classes</strong> A, B, C offers addresses for networks of three distinct network
                sizes. Class D is only used for
                multicast, and class E reserved exclusively for experimental purposes.
                <br>
                Class A Network
                This IP address class is used when there are a large number of hosts. In a Class A type of network, the
                first 8 bits (also called the first octet) identify the network, and the remaining have 24 bits for the
                host into that network.
                <br>
                Class B Network
                In a B class IP address, the binary addresses start with 10. In this IP address, the class decimal
                number that can be between 128 to 191.
                <br>
                Class C Network
                Class C is a type of IP address that is used for the small network. In this class, three octets are used
                to indent the network. This IP ranges between 192 to 223.
                <br>
                Class D Network
                Class D addresses are only used for multicasting applications. Class D is never used for regular
                networking operations.
                <br>
                Class E Network
                Class E IP address is defined by including the starting four network address bits as 1, which allows you
                two to incorporate addresses from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. However, E class is reserved, and its
                usage is never defined. Therefore, many network implementations discard these addresses as undefined or
                illegal.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="network-mask">
            <p>
                4. <strong>Network mask</strong> is represented as integer number and is the same for all hosts on a
                given subnet.
                The binary length of the mask is specific to a specific version of the IP protocol - it is the same as
                the
                length of the address. In the case of IPv4, it is 32 bits. Examples of masks: 255.255.255.0,
                255.255.0.0,
                255.0.0.0
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="routing-table">
            <p> 5. <strong>Routing</strong> table is a set of rules, often viewed in table format, that is used to
                determine where data
                packets traveling over an Internet Protocol (IP) network will be directed. All IP-enabled devices,
                including routers and switches, use routing tables.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="default-gateway"><strong>6. Default gateway</strong> is the piece of hardware that sits between
            user's home network and
            the rest of the internet. In most local networks, the default gateway is the Wi-Fi router. It allows user to
            access servers and devices outside of their network — all the traffic they send and receive goes through it.
            Without a default gateway, browsing the internet would be a much more laborious effort.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="broadcast">
            <p>6. <strong>Broadcast</strong> means that the network delivers one copy of a packet to each destination.
                Broadcasting is the process of sending data to all devices in a network, typically done using a
                broadcast
                address. It is a way to communicate with all devices on a subnet simultaneously.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subnet-address">
            <p>7. Consider IP address = 192.168.2.25
                First few bitsidentify
                network/subnet
                Remaining bits identify host/interface
                Number of subnet bits is called subnet mask,
                e.g.
                Subnet IP Address range is 192.168.2.0 -
                192.168.2.255 or Mask = 255.255.255.0
                Subnet IP Address range is 192.168.2.0 -
                192.168.2.15 or Mask = 255.255.255.240</p>
        </div>
        <div class="private-network-address">
            <p>8. <strong>Private network addresses</strong> are not routed on the
                Internet, and no traffic can be
                sent to them from the Internet; they are only supposed to work within the local network.
                Private addresses include IP addresses from the following subnets:
            <ul>
                <li>Range from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 — a 10.0.0.0 network with a 255.0.0.0 or /8 (an 8-bit) mask
                </li>
                <li>Range from 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 — a 172.16.0.0 network with a 255.240.0.0 or /12</li>
                <li>A 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 range, which is a 192.168.0.0 network masked by 255.255.0.0 or /16
                </li>
                <li>A special range 100.64.0.0 to 100.127.255.255 with a 255.192.0.0 or /10 network mask</li>
            </ul>

            Those are reserved IP addresses. These addresses are intended for use in closed local area networks, and no
            one globally controls the allocation of such addresses.
            Direct access to the Internet from a private IP address is not possible. In this case, the connection to the
            Internet must go through NAT (Network Address Translation replaces the private IP address with a public
            one). Private IP addresses within the same local network must be unique and cannot duplicate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="network-address-translation">
            <p>9. <strong>Network Address Translation (NAT)</strong> is a process that enables one, unique
                IP address to represent an entire group of computers. In network address translation, a network device,
                often a router or NAT firewall, assigns a computer or computers inside a private network a public
                address.</p>
