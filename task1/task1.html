    <h1>Theoretical Overview</h1>

    <h2>1.1 Describe ISO/OSI model and protocol assignment</h2>
    <p>The OSI model defines seven layers:</p>
    <p>
      The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework
      used to understand how different protocols communicate over a network. It
      consists of seven layers:
    </p>

    <h3>Physical Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The physical layer is the lowest layer in the OSI model. It deals with the
      transmission and reception of raw data bits over a physical medium, such
      as copper wires, optical fibers, or wireless channels. It defines the
      physical characteristics of the transmission medium, including connectors,
      voltage levels, and data transmission rates.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Link Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The data link layer establishes and maintains a reliable link between two
      adjacent nodes connected by a physical layer. It ensures error-free
      transmission of data by providing framing, error detection, and, if
      possible, correction. It also manages access to the physical medium,
      resolves hardware addresses (MAC addresses), and controls data flow
      between devices.
    </p>

    <h3>Network Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The network layer facilitates communication between different networks. It
      is responsible for logical addressing, routing packets across multiple
      networks, and determining the best path for data to reach its destination.
      The Internet Protocol (IP) operates at this layer, and it enables
      internetwork communication.
    </p>

    <h3>Transport Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The transport layer ensures end-to-end communication between host devices.
      It segments and reassembles data into smaller units known as segments,
      provides error checking, flow control, and ensures data integrity. It
      includes protocols like Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User
      Datagram Protocol (UDP).
    </p>

    <h3>Session Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication
      sessions between applications on different devices. It manages the dialog
      control and synchronization between presentation layer entities, allowing
      for efficient data exchange.
    </p>

    <h3>Presentation Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption,
      compression, and formatting. It ensures that data exchanged between
      applications is readable, regardless of the differences in data
      representation across different systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Application Layer</h3>
    <p>
      The application layer is the topmost layer and interacts directly with the
      end-user. It provides network services directly to applications, allowing
      users to access network resources and services. Various protocols such as
      HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS operate at this layer, enabling specific
      application functionalities.
    </p>

    <h2>1.2. Protocol Data Units for Layers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical Layer - Bits</li>
      <li>Data Link Layer - Frames</li>
      <li>Network Layer - Packets</li>
      <li>Transport Layer - Segments</li>
      <li>Session Layer - Data</li>
      <li>Presentation Layer - Data</li>
      <li>Application Layer - Messages</li>
    </ul>
