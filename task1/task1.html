  <h2>1.1 Describe ISO/OSI model and protocol assignment</h2>
  <p>The OSI model defines seven layers:</p>
  <p>
    The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework
    used to understand how different protocols communicate over a network. It
    consists of seven layers:
  </p>

  <h3>Physical Layer</h3>
  <p>
    The physical layer is the lowest layer in the OSI model. It deals with the
    transmission and reception of raw data bits over a physical medium, such
    as copper wires, optical fibers, or wireless channels. It defines the
    physical characteristics of the transmission medium, including connectors,
    voltage levels, and data transmission rates.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Link Layer</h3>
  <p>
    The data link layer establishes and maintains a reliable link between two
    adjacent nodes connected by a physical layer. It ensures error-free
    transmission of data by providing framing, error detection, and, if
    possible, correction. It also manages access to the physical medium,
    resolves hardware addresses (MAC addresses), and controls data flow
    between devices.
  </p>

  <h3>Network Layer</h3>
  <p>
    The network layer facilitates communication between different networks. It
    is responsible for logical addressing, routing packets across multiple
    networks, and determining the best path for data to reach its destination.
    The Internet Protocol (IP) operates at this layer, and it enables
    internetwork communication.
  </p>

  <h3>Transport Layer</h3>
  <p>
    The transport layer ensures end-to-end communication between host devices.
    It segments and reassembles data into smaller units known as segments,
    provides error checking, flow control, and ensures data integrity. It
    includes protocols like Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User
    Datagram Protocol (UDP).
  </p>

  <h3>Session Layer</h3>
  <p>
    The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication
    sessions between applications on different devices. It manages the dialog
    control and synchronization between presentation layer entities, allowing
    for efficient data exchange.
  </p>

  <h3>Presentation Layer</h3>
  <p>
    The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption,
    compression, and formatting. It ensures that data exchanged between
    applications is readable, regardless of the differences in data
    representation across different systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Application Layer</h3>
  <p>
    The application layer is the topmost layer and interacts directly with the
    end-user. It provides network services directly to applications, allowing
    users to access network resources and services. Various protocols such as
    HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS operate at this layer, enabling specific
    application functionalities.
  </p>

    <p>
      ICMP, integral to the TCP/IP suite at the IP layer (Layer 3), operates
      alongside IP processing. It's recognized as the protocol used by the
      'ping' command for sending echo requests and receiving replies. However,
      due to security concerns, many routers disable echo responses, affecting
      the ping command's usefulness. ICMP's primary role is to report basic
      packet delivery problems, including: Handling Maximum Transmission Unit
      (MTU) limitations by fragmenting large packets or sending fragmentation
      needed messages. Notifying about packet expiration after traversing
      multiple hops (time exceeded error). Indicating when packets fail to
      reach their destination (e.g., ARP broadcast mismatch). Communicating
      potential routing issues, although routing protocols often handle this
      better. Disabling certain ICMP functions, particularly route suggestion,
      is advisable for security reasons, as routing protocols are more
      effective in determining optimal routes. Formally defined in RFC 792,
      ICMP sets standards for its implementation and usage within networks.

      <div class="text">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</strong>
            FTP is one of the oldest and most widely used protocols for transferring files over a network.
            It operates on two channels: the command channel (used for sending commands) and the data channel (used for
            transferring files).
            FTP supports authentication and authorization mechanisms, but it lacks encryption, making it less secure for
            transmitting sensitive data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol):</strong>
            SFTP is a secure file transfer protocol that runs over the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol,
            providing a secure connection for file transfer.
            It encrypts both commands and data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. SFTP is commonly used for secure
            and reliable file transfers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure):</strong>
            FTPS is an extension of FTP that adds support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer
            (SSL) encryption.
            It offers authentication and encryption similar to SFTP but operates over separate control and data
            channels, providing security for FTP-based file transfers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong>
            While primarily used for web browsing, HTTP can also facilitate file transfers.
            However, it's less efficient than specialized file transfer protocols because it wasn't designed
            specifically for large file transfers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):</strong>
            HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption (SSL/TLS) to secure data transmission.
            It's commonly used for secure web communication, including file downloads or uploads via websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SCP (Secure Copy Protocol):</strong>
            SCP is a secure file transfer protocol that uses SSH for data transfer and authentication.
            It allows secure copying of files between hosts on a network.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol):</strong>
            TFTP is a simpler form of FTP, often used for transferring small amounts of data where simplicity
            and low overhead are more critical than advanced features.
            However, TFTP lacks security features like authentication and encryption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AS2 (Applicability Statement 2):</strong>
            AS2 is a protocol used for secure and reliable data exchange between businesses over the internet.
            It employs digital certificates and encryption for data integrity and confidentiality.
          </li>

      <h3>task 2.9</h3>
      <p><ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Directory Indexing:</strong> If a web server's directory does not contain an index file (like index.html), the server may be configured to display a listing of the files and directories within that directory.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Default Page:</strong> Web servers usually have a default file (like index.html or default.html) that they look for and serve when a user accesses a directory directly without specifying a file. This prevents directory listing and displays a specific page instead.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Directory Listing Options:</strong> Web server configurations often allow administrators to enable or disable directory listing. When directory listing is enabled and there's no index file present, the server displays a list of files and directories in that folder. This can be useful for sharing files but might pose a security risk by exposing directory contents.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Custom Error Pages:</strong> Some web servers can be set up to display custom error pages (like 404 Not Found or 403 Forbidden) when a directory is accessed, and an index file or default page is absent. This improves user experience and security by preventing directory browsing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Access Control:</strong> Access permissions can be set on directories to control who can view their contents. This prevents unauthorized users from seeing directory listings or accessing files.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Server Configuration Files:</strong> Configuration files (e.g., .htaccess for Apache server) allow administrators to specify rules for how directories should be handled. They can define whether directory listings are allowed or disallowed and specify custom error pages or default files.
    </li>
